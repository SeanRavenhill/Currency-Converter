### Project: Currency Converter

#### About
Want to convert one currency to another? You can go to your bank website and do the math by yourself. Or you can write a program to do it quickly and efficiently! The Currency Converter is a simple console program that calculates the amount of money you get by converting one currency to another.

#### Learning outcomes
You will learn many concepts of Python — basic types, variables, arithmetic operations, loops, and working with files. Get a taste of more advanced features — JSON format, caching, and how to work with the network. You will write a currency converter program that uses a third-party service.

#### *Personal Notes:
Enjoyed working on this program. Learned use JSON in a more practical application. Working with third-parties, and caching. Please note there are two version of my converter. Version _v00 is applicable to the JetBrains task, and thus had to be written with caching etc. in order to pass the unit tests. <br><br>
However I've written a Version _v01 that does away with caching as I want my converter to always have up to date rates. I've also added in some instructions and input strings for a better user experience, as well as made sure to provide the user the option to exit the program.
